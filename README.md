This repository contains three projects that demonstrate how to use Python to perform data analysis and machine learning tasks on respective datasets. The projects are:

- Churn modelling: This project aims to predict customer churn (the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company) based on various features such as demographics, account information and usage behavior. Algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forests have been used to predict the churn.

- Credit card fraud detection: This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using credit cards based on various features such as time, amount, and anonymized principal components. Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forests have been used to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

- Spam message detection: This project aims to classify text messages as spam or ham (legitimate) based on various features such as word frequency, length, and punctuation. Techniques like TF-IDF with classifiers like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines have been used to identify spam messages.
